# explore-gun-deaths-in-us

- This is my solution for the Guided Project: Exploring Gun Deaths in the US on dataquest.io.

- [The dataset](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/guns-data) contains information on gun deaths in the US from 2012 to 2014.

- The aim is to find patterns in the demographics of the victims.
